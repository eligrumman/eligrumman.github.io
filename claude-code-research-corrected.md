## Current Technical Implementation (Verified)

### Rate Limiting Mechanism
**Source**: [Portkey.ai Technical Analysis](https://portkey.ai/blog/claude-code-limits/)

**5-Hour Rolling Window System:**
- Session begins with first prompt and lasts exactly 5 hours
- Multiple concurrent sessions can run simultaneously  
- Token-based tracking: input + output tokens = total consumption
- Example: 1,000 input tokens + 2,000 output tokens = 3,000 total tokens consumed

**Weekly Rate Limits (Starting August 28, 2025):**
- Two separate weekly caps: overall usage limit + Opus 4-specific limit
- Resets every seven days
- Works in addition to (not replacement of) 5-hour limits

### Current Usage Allowances by Plan
**Source**: [Anthropic Official Support](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11145838-using-claude-code-with-your-pro-or-max-plan)

**Pro Plan ($20/month):**
- ~10-40 Claude Code prompts per 5-hour window
- 40-80 hours of Sonnet 4 weekly (starting Aug 28)
- Sonnet 4 model only
- Best for "light work on small repositories (typically under 1,000 lines of code)"

**Max 5x Plan ($100/month):**
- ~50-200 Claude Code prompts per 5-hour window
- 140-280 hours of Sonnet 4 weekly
- 15-35 hours of Opus 4 weekly
- Access to both Sonnet 4 and Opus 4.1

**Max 20x Plan ($200/month):**
- ~200-800 Claude Code prompts per 5-hour window
- 240-480 hours of Sonnet 4 weekly
- 24-40 hours of Opus 4 weekly
- Full model access with "more access to Claude Opus 4.1"

### Token Pricing Structure
**Source**: [Portkey.ai Technical Documentation](https://portkey.ai/blog/claude-code-limits/)

- **Opus 4**: $15 input / $75 output (per million tokens)
- **Sonnet 4**: $3 input / $15 output (per million tokens)
- **Haiku**: $0.80 input / $4 output (per million tokens)

## Community Response and Tools

### User Reactions
**Source**: [Hacker News Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44598254)

**Key concerns raised:**
- Dependency risks: "hard dependency on third party service with unclear long term availability"
- Cost confusion: Users reported "burning through $1000/week on a $200/month plan"
- Workflow disruption: Complex multi-step workflows consuming significant tokens

**Developer quote**: "Who would have thought including a hard dependency on third part service with unclear long term availability would be a problem!" - m4rtink

### Community Monitoring Tools
**Source**: [GitHub - ccusage tool](https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage)

**ccusage CLI Tool:**
- Analyzes Claude Code usage from local JSONL files
- Features: daily/monthly reports, session tracking, 5-hour billing window analysis
- Installation: `bunx ccusage` (recommended) or `npx ccusage@latest`
- Real-time monitoring dashboard available

**Additional Tools:**
- Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor by Maciek-roboblog: Real-time terminal monitoring with ML predictions
- CC Usage: Subscription usage visibility and workflow optimization

## Policy Rationale
**Source**: [Multiple TechCrunch articles and official statements]

**Anthropic's stated reasons for limits:**
1. Curb continuous background usage (24/7 operations)
2. Prevent account sharing and reselling
3. Maintain service reliability under "unprecedented demand"
4. Ensure fair resource distribution

**Implementation approach:**
- Grandfather existing usage patterns initially
- Formal announcement with 30-day notice for weekly limits
- Preserve existing 5-hour windows while adding weekly caps
